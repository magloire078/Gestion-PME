    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to ensure authorization independence, clarity, and scalability for the Gestion PME application.  Companies are stored under a top-level `companies` collection. Invoices and Expenses are stored as subcollections under each company. This design promotes data locality and simplifies querying for company-specific data.  Authorization independence is achieved by leveraging path-based ownership for Company data and ensuring that invoice and expenses data contain redundant authorization data (the `companyId`) to avoid `get()` calls in security rules. This strategy directly addresses Authorization Independence. The DBAC is achieved since access is controlled by `request.auth.uid` and the path structure, removing the need for custom claims.  QAPs (Rules are not Filters) are inherently supported due to path-based ownership. List operations can be secured by scoping queries to the user's company.  Finally, the structure allows simple enforcement of data integrity using security rules for ownership, timestamps, and other invariants. The design adheres to structural segregation by keeping the company-owned data separate under each company document."
